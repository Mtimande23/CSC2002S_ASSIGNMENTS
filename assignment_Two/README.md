In this assignment, we explored the implementation of an AVL Tree, a self-balancing 
variant of the Binary Search Tree (BST). The primary objective was to assess my 
understanding in two key areas: 
1. Implementing fundamental AVL Tree operations, including insertion, deletion 
(though not heavily used in this assignment), and rotations to maintain balance. 
2. Analysing and comparing the AVL Tree’s efficiency with other tree structures in 
terms of time complexity and performance.

Aim: 
The goal of this assignment was to implement a program that: 
• Creates and inserts line objects into an AVL Tree. 
• Performs search queries using terms from a text file. 
• Provides appropriate responses based on search results.
